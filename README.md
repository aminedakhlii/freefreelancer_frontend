# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.21.

## Environment setup

Environment files are not committed. After cloning, create them from the examples:

```bash
cp src/environments/environment.ts.example src/environments/environment.ts
cp src/environments/environment.prod.ts.example src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

Then edit `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts` and set your Supabase URL, anon key, and (for prod) `siteUrl`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
